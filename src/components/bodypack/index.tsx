            The legacy of Bodypack began in 1953, long before its conception. Coming all the way from Jakarta, Lukman Lukito and his wife opened up a bag shop business inside a 3 m2 shop at Jalan ABC no. 3, Bandung. The shop eventually is
            handed to his son, Ronny Lukito. Fueled with curiosity and courage, he set out on a journey to find the secret behind quality design.

            Our journey officially started in 1996, when we crafted solutions in the form of bags for the community around us. Throughout the years, weâ€™ve grown to adapt to the changing lifestyle. From adopting the street design for the
            streetwear scene, serving minimalist silhouettes for the urban professional, going for a more dynamic with utility and stylish looks, and experimenting with techwear.

            We continuously redefine ourselves through the years. We did it because we wanted to learn how to serve the market better. Through all the transformation, we realize it is easy to get lost and question ourselves, "Who are we,
